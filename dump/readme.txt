Hello! In 'Shitty Space Game' your goal is simple - blow up lots of aliens.

Here are the controls:

Player orientation - Mouse movement
Movement (relative to mouse position) - WASD
Shoot laser - LMB
Shoot guided missile - RMB

There is a file called config.txt in this folder, which you can edit to change the difficulty, graphical detail, etc.

When you play, there should be three bars in the top left:
-Red is health. When it runs out, you explode.
-Blue is your shields. These get damaged before you do, and recharge slowly.
-Green represents energy. This is super important: shooting, moving and recharging your shields all use energy, so if you run out, you're sunk.
The enemies in the game use the same system.

CTRL-click on the buttons on the right to choose which systems are prioritised.

BALANCED - Is the default profile.
SHIELDS - Will very quickly recharge your shields, but at great energy expense. You also accelerate more slowly.
ENGINES - Diverts power to your engines. You will accelerate much faster, with much greater energy usage. Your shields will recharge more slowly.
GUNS - Makes your shields recharge more slowly, and reduces power to the engines, allowing you to shoot more often.

The top right is the minimap. It's a bit broken, and really ugly.
