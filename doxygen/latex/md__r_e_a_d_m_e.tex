\subsection*{Getting Started}

To start your project clone this repo into your home directory

``` git clone \href{mailto:git@github.com}{\tt git@github.\-com}\-:N\-C\-C\-A/\mbox{[}your username\mbox{]}-\/\-C\-A1.\-git

cd \mbox{[}your usrname\mbox{]}-\/\-C\-A1

You can then add your files and edit things. Once you are ready to upload (and do this often)

``` git add . git commit -\/am \char`\"{}added files\char`\"{} git push origin master ``` The commit message should make sense in the context of what you are doing such as modify certain files etc.
